Below is the adapted content for your coffee-themed website, transformed from the Omnifood restaurant content to align with your Brewmobil project, focusing on coffee. The structure remains the same to fit your HTML/CSS course project, but the theme is now centered around a coffee subscription and delivery service. I've replaced meal-related concepts with coffee products, adjusted branding, and tailored the content to reflect a coffee business while maintaining the original intent and structure.

## About Brewmobil

We are a technology company first, with a passion for enhancing daily life through exceptional coffee experiences. In today’s fast-paced world, people are busy with work, family, and hobbies, leaving little time to source and brew high-quality coffee. This can lead to settling for subpar coffee or missing out on the joy of a great cup. We solve this problem with an AI-driven approach. Users can use our app to select their coffee preferences, including roast hunting and brewing styles, and our AI algorithm creates a personalized weekly coffee plan tailored to their tastes. But we don’t stop there. We partner with local roasters and cafes to roast, brew, and deliver premium coffee from your curated plan, available in select cities. All this is bundled into a monthly subscription, where users can choose to receive one or two coffee deliveries per day, every day of the month.

## Branding

### Notes on Adaptation

- **Theme Shift**: Changed the focus from healthy meals to premium coffee, aligning with your Brewmobil project. Terms like "meal plan" became "coffee plan," and "cooking" became "roasting/brewing."
- **Branding**: Updated the headline to emphasize coffee delivery and chose a rich coffee brown (#6F4E37) as the brand color to evoke the essence of coffee.
- **Features**: Reworded to reflect coffee-specific benefits, like sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly packaging, while keeping the subscription model intact.
- **Preferences**: Replaced dietary preferences with coffee-related ones (e.g., roast types, brewing methods) to match the new theme.
- **Sample Items**: Converted meals into coffee types with relevant metrics (caffeine content, FlavorScore) instead of calories and NutriScore.
- **Pricing**: Lowered prices ($399 to $199, $649 to $349) to reflect the lower cost of coffee compared to full meals, while maintaining the two-tier structure.
- **Testimonials**: Adjusted to focus on coffee-related benefits, keeping the tone and structure similar.
- **Photos**: Suggested reimagining the provided photos as coffee-related visuals to fit the theme without requiring new assets.
