Welcome to **Brewmobil**, a beautiful, fully responsive coffee-themed landing page — and my **first-ever web development project using HTML & CSS**!  
This project was inspired by the **Omnifood** project from the Udemy course [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.
